          In my master thesis, conducted in partnership with Fraunhofer AICOS, I focused on developing a
          software framework to facilitate the creation of applications utilizing mini drones in indoor environments.
          The project involved customizing the Crazyflie 2.0 platform, making it suitable for this specific
          application. The goal was to provide a tool that would simplify the process for developers to integrate
          mini drones into diverse indoor settings using a monocular visual odometry algorithm and sensors like a camera and IR distance sensors.
          One of the key applications demonstrated in this project was the use of drones in a retail environment.
          This illustrated the practical utility and versatility of the framework in a real-world scenario. The
          portfolio includes an image showing the modified Crazyflie 2.0 platform on my hand, along with a screenshot
          depicting the drone's use in a retail setting. For a detailed insight into the project, the complete master
          thesis is accessible <a href='https://hdl.handle.net/10216/107646' target='_blank'>here</a>. This project marked
          my initial foray into and provided a substantial learning opportunity in areas such as visual odometry, SLAM
          (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), drone hardware, and state-of-the-art drone technologies.">

          During my tenure at Fraunhofer, I was involved in the development of Kallisto, a low-consumption,
          low-profile IoT hardware platform. This project, in collaboration with Sensry, focused on creating a
          highly adaptable device tailored for a wide range of IoT applications. Kallisto stands out for its
          integration of diverse sensors, including an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and various ambient sensors
          like a barometer. Moreover, it features specifications such as wireless charging, making it a
          cutting-edge solution in the IoT space for its size. My role extended beyond the development of the hardware and
          firmware; I was instrumental in devising multiple use case applications. These applications not only
          showcased the platform's capabilities but also served as a foundational platform for other projects and
          clients. The versatility of Kallisto allows for its direct application or customization according to
          specific IoT needs, highlighting its utility in various scenarios. For more detailed information about
          Kallisto's specifications and capabilities, the product description can be found at

          functionalities like fall detection, emergency alerting, activity monitoring, and fall risk
          estimation. My specific role in this project involved the development of the activity monitoring algorithms.
          The primary challenge was optimizing these algorithms for minimal battery consumption and ensuring they
          delivered accurate results on a hardware platform with limited capabilities. Notably, the device lacked
          floating-point arithmetic, adding complexity to the task of creating efficient yet effective algorithms. For more information on the GoLiveClip and

          In a significant robotics project spanning nearly four years, I played a pivotal role in developing an
          autonomous UAV-based solution for inspecting wind turbines. Joining the team during its proof-of-concept stage,
          I contributed substantially through to its successful product launch. This solution, now operational in over 10
          countries, has serviced 958 turbines, encompassing 48 unique models, within just a year of its launch.
          My expertise was particularly instrumental in critical field missions, where I was often recognized as the go-to
          specialist. My deep understanding of the system was crucial in resolving issues quickly and ensuring smooth
          operation. A notable achievement was the successful deployment of our solution in offshore environments,
          demonstrating adaptability and competence in high-pressure, challenging conditions.
          My technical contributions encompassed developing advanced perception and navigation algorithms for the UAVs,
          utilizing sensors like LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs. My work involved leveraging knowledge in areas such as forward
          and inverse kinematics, optimization, collision-free motion planning, control system design, rigid body
          dynamics, geometry, and linear algebra. I was also responsible for ensuring the reliability of the code through
          extensive validation processes, including Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulations, Continuous
          Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) strategies, static code analysis, and profiling. My approach to
          maintaining code quality involved peer-reviewed processes via pull requests, with a keen awareness of compile
          times.
          During this project, I expanded my technical repertoire by learning and implementing third-party tools like PCL,
          OMPL, Orocos, and the Ceres solver. The details of the UAV wind turbine inspection solution I worked on can be
          found at <a href='https://www.bladeinsight.com/inspection-solutions.html#A' target='_blank'>BladeInsight

        <img src="assets/portfolio/skate.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" class="w3-hover-opacity" alt="Custom-Built Electric Skateboard ||
          This project involved building an electric skateboard for my daily commute. I started by crafting the board
          itself, cutting and gluing the wood to create the base. For the mobility components, I selected appropriate
          trucks and wheels and purchased the necessary electrical parts.
          The skateboard is powered by two 8Ah batteries arranged in series and features a battery monitor for effective
          power management. It's driven by a 250 kV motor, paired with a programmable VESC (Vedder Electronic Speed
          Controller), which allows for customizable control over the skateboard's speed and acceleration.
          I managed to test the skateboard up to a speed of 20 km/h, although it's capable of higher speeds. For
          protection and aesthetics, I also made a custom plastic cover for the skateboard using a thermoforming machine.
          This project was a hands-on experience in electric vehicle assembly, combining
          woodworking, electronics, and mechanical skills to create a fun commuting solution.">

          alt="DIY Portable Bluetooth Speaker ||
          This personal project involved building a portable Bluetooth speaker from scratch. The speaker's enclosure
          was handcrafted, with the main body made of pine and the front and back panels from plywood. It houses two 5W
          drivers and is powered by a single 18650 cell battery, which provides about 5 hours of usage at full volume.
          In the design, I implemented a 1:1 transformer to separate the power and logic systems, helping to reduce
          feedback sounds. While the sound quality is decent, it's clear that there was no extensive sound dynamics
          analysis during its construction. This was my first attempt at building a speaker, so while it has
          imperfections in audio quality, its continued functioning after 7 years speaks to its durability.
          This project was as much a learning experience as it was about building a usable product. In retrospect, there
          are several aspects I would improve, especially in sound quality and material choice. The idea of creating a
          second, improved version of this speaker is something I'm considering for the future.">

          For the TEDx event at the University of Porto, I undertook the task of constructing the stage logo. The logo
          was crafted from several foam sheets, which were glued together and then covered with cardboard for additional
          structure and stability. The final step in the construction process involved painting the assembled logo in
          the traditional TEDx colors.
          In order to cut the foam sheets. I created a homemade cutting device using a heat wire extracted from a hair dryer, which was then powered by a transformer
          from an old laptop. This setup effectively heated the wire, allowing it to cut through the foam with
          precision.
          Apart from the construction of the logo, I was also involved in the broader organizational aspects of the TEDx
          event.">

        I dedicated some of my free time to building two types of aircraft for personal enjoyment: a fixed-wing model
        and a multirotor. The fixed-wing aircraft, known for its straightforward and stable flight pattern, was a
        project that allowed me to explore traditional aviation design and aerodynamics. The multirotor, on the other
        hand, offered a different experience with its agility and flexibility in flight.
        Both projects required careful assembly of parts, balancing, and setting up control systems. This hobby was not
        just for fun but also an application of my skills in areas like aerodynamics and remote control technology.
        Flying these aircrafts provided a hands-on understanding of flight mechanics and the satisfaction of piloting
        something I built myself.">
